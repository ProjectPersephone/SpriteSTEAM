# SpriteSTEAM
STEAM education elements for the Sprite picosatellite

Readings:

- our proposal for a simple kit to help students understand the complexity heat flows, in space and on the ground: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXS-L3TITFTscPt-rEdWPuGxG3G0lJ-JblA4cFKX0k4/edit

- our proposal for using music in the classroom to help teach the communications theory behind Sprite's communications with ground stations. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jvAutZOK-oTKVhUwr3GIXUakZ8oVpEgYwVftfqEvYD4/edit

- presentation slides including some other ideas: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SuPp06Mu9vdNHGf4Ls2tTCGeB2S8RchysAYGBmpC6fI/edit#slide=id.gabd0677b_081

   Build a kit for field trips on which students simulate communication between atmosphere and orbit by splitting up, climbing to two different mountain peaks, and transmitting between them. 
   
   Write instructions for mounting a sprite on the cap of a pen (or if necessary, some larger writing device) -- see if it can digitize writing using the accelerometers and perhaps send the scribbles as signals. (Other games are possible, like hide-and-seek with accelerometer-based map-clues going to the seeker from Sprites planted on hiders' bodies.)
   
   Build a kit for synchronized drop of a Sprite inside a box as the box is dropped from a multistory building -- microgravity demonstrated by accelerometer reading changes.
